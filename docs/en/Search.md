Search
================================

Search for the forum module is going to rely on the Silverstripe Full Text Search module so both of these will need to be installed.

As the Full Text search module is still in development search will not work at present in the forum module the previous version of
SilverStripe 2.4 used MyISAM as the default database engine, SilverStripe 3.0 uses InnoDB as the default MySql database engine which
is the reason why it will have to rely on the Full Text module to be present
